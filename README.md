# predicting-violence-against-women
In this data science project, we performed exploratory data analysis on the OECD's indicators for Violence Against Women and searched for factors that could predict violence against women. This project was completed as part of the class CDAD-UH Data and Society, taught by Professor Roberet Kubinec at New York University Abu Dhabi.
