# Predicting Violence Against Women Using the Women's Economic Opportunity Index (WEOI)
In this data science project, we performed exploratory data analysis on the OECD's indicators for Violence Against Women and searched for factors that could predict violence against women. We perform regression analysis and causal inference to test the hypothesis that the Women's Economic Opportunity Index is a cause of violence against women.

This project was completed as part of the class CDAD-UH Data and Society, taught by Professor Roberet Kubinec at New York University Abu Dhabi.
